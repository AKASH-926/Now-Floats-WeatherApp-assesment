Exercise: Flutter Weather App
Problem
Your task is to create a Flutter weather app that shows the current weather and forecast for a location. The app should allow users to search for locations and save their favorite locations for quick access.

The app should have the following screens:

A home screen that displays the current weather for the user's current location and a list of the user's favorite locations.
A search screen that allows the user to search for locations by name, city, state, or country.
A detail screen that displays the current weather and forecast for a selected location.
The app should use the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data.

Requirements
The home screen should show the current weather for the user's current location.
The home screen should also show a list of the user's favorite locations. The list should be stored locally on the device and persist across app sessions.
The search screen should allow the user to search for locations by name, city, state, or country. The search results should be displayed in a list.
The detail screen should show the current weather and forecast for a selected location.
The app should use a provider for state management.
The app should have unit tests for critical functionality.
Evaluation
Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Functionality: Does the app meet the requirements and function as intended?
Code quality: Is the code well-structured, easy to read, and maintainable?
User experience: Is the app easy to use and visually appealing?
Best practices: Does the code follow best practices for Flutter development?
Testing: Are there unit tests for critical functionality?
